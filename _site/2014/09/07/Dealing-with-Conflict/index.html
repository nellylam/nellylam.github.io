				<p>When thinking of the times when I had to deal with conflict, I realized that there are definitely recognizable patterns.</p>

<p class='articleheadings'>How I typically respond</p>


<p>There is a strong correlation in how I deal with conflict and who the conflict is with. It’s clear to me that if the other person is someone with authority or in a professional setting, I tend to be more reserved. When the other person is someone close to me, I will tend to be more vocal.</p>

<p>My first instinct is to be very defensive. I think “what did I do to deserve this?” or “I’m right, and they’re wrong!” The initial emotions always overtake my reasoning skills, so I get really quiet.</p>

<p>This is good and bad. It’s great that I actually pause and think about the situation before acting. It’s bad, because I tend to think more negatively than if I was in a good mood. Of course, a conflict means that the mood is already on edge, so the thoughts often veer in that negative direction.</p>

<p class='articleheadings'>Learning to cope</p>


<p>I am now learning to be more thoughtful and more positive. I have found myself in situations where I am about to release my temper again, but instead I take a few deep breaths, and I try to speak after I get more perspective on the situation.</p>

<p>For example, when my significant other said something that made me upset, I ask, why am I upset? What did he say that made me feel this way? Often times, the reason is good enough to communicate to the other person. The reason could be “that hurt my feelings” or “I feel kind of left out” or whatever it may be.</p>

<p>By being honest with yourself and the other person, it has diverted the attention to resolving the conflict instead of escalating it.</p>

<p>I’m still not perfect, of course. There are still many instances where I wish I had been less quick to speak or act, and instead been more level-headed.</p>

<p class='articleheadings'>Main source of conflict</p>


<p>The biggest culprit of conflicts is probably the lack of communication, or <em>mis</em>communication. Communication is extremely difficult. The message sent and the message received between two parties is never perfect. The sender and the target have different viewpoints, perspectives, thoughts, feelings, languages even.</p>

<p>Emails, text messages, and even phone conversations are the most likely mediums for communications that go awry. It is during one of these types of conversations that I often misinterpret the meaning of something and things escalate quickly.</p>

<p>At times like these, it’s best to give the other person the benefit of the doubt. It’s also not advisable to have a complicated conversation without at least being able to see the other person, because body language can help convey the true meaning much more effectively.</p>

<p>If you’re on the phone, try to arrange an in person meeting or at least a webcam session. If you’re texting, and the message is complicated, make the phone call instead.</p>

<p class='articleheadings'>Your mileage may vary</p>


<p>I’m trying to describe many different situations, because when thinking back to conflicts I have had in the past, it’s clear that the way in which the conflicts arose vary greatly and should be handled in different ways.</p>

<p>What applies to all situations is this: Pause. Take a few seconds (or as long as you need) to digest your thoughts, be mindful of your own feelings and the other person’s as well. Then act in a way that is trying to resolve the situation and not escalate it further.</p>

<p>We can all learn to get along in this world. It’s all about understanding.</p>
