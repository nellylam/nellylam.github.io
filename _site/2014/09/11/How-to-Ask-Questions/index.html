				<p>No matter what field you’re in, no matter what problem you’re trying to solve, the best thing you can do is to figure out what the question is first.</p>

<p>The toughest part is framing the question.</p>

<p><img src="/images/einstein-question.jpg" alt="Einstein Quote" /></p>

<p class='articleheadings'>Basics</p>
<p><em class='subheading'>
What are you really trying to answer?</em></p>

<p>I find myself stuck on a problem sometimes, and all I know is “it’s not working.” How do I find the answer to this? It’s not even a question yet, it’s just a problem. I can’t search for “my code is not working.”</p>

<p>We need more information. What type of problem is this?
<em class='subheading'>What language are you working in?</em></p>

<p>Ok, “problem in Javascript.” That’s a start.</p>

<p>What are you trying to accomplish?</p>

<p>“I want to return the property key of my object literal.” Not bad. There are some keywords that others can easily identify.</p>

<p>One really helpful tip is this: <em class='subheading'>Have you tried something already?</em></p>

<p>Usually one is more inclined to answer a question if they are given a context as to what you have attempted already. If you haven’t tried to solve the problem yourself, then you shouldn’t be asking a question yet. If you have, great! That’s more information!</p>

<p>“I have tried this: ________”
“I encountered these problems…”</p>

<p class='articleheadings'>First Impressions</p>
<p>
It’s important to really frame the question well at the start. That’s your first impression. You want to be concise and get to the point, but also include any major information for context.</p>

<p class='articleheadings'>Including Code</p>
<p>
Then if there is code that might be helpful, you should include it, but making sure you only include what is relevant, and everything that is relevant. In other words, some things you can leave out, some things you may want to include.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a problem with your script, you may need to include your html and/or stylesheet. Just make sure that someone reading it for the first time can read and understand it clearly.</p>

<p class='articleheadings'>Frame of mind</p>
<p>Asking programming questions is not unlike asking questions to your supervisor or manager. You have to show initiative, that you have attempted to solve the problem yourself, and only go to them if you have something to show. You have to assume they are always busy, and this is interrupting whatever they are doing to help you.</p>

<p>Be grateful! There are of course people who are happy to help, but I find that I am more happy to help someone who appreciates the answer.</p>

<p class='articleheadings'>Personal example time:</p>
<p>
Does anybody know any good resources to learn how to integrate JavaScript into HTML + CSS? And should we be diving into jQuery too?</p>

<p><em class='subheading'>The answer I received:</em>
You will be doing plenty of JQuery in phase 2, I would focus on learning the basics of JS now. You link a JS page just like a CSS page only using the script tag. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script</p>

<p>What I really wanted to know was how to manipulate DOM objects using JavaScript. I later learned that jQuery was the easiest way to learn this.</p>

<p>What I failed to do was frame the question correctly. I remember feeling stuck because I did not know the correct technical terms for what I wanted to do, because I didn’t know what I wanted to do! I should have at least given an example of what I wanted to accomplish. Did I want to move objects on a page? Did I want to create buttons and then make things appear?</p>

<p>Looking back, if I had an example, I probably could have done a google search and at least attempted to make something happen, but I didn’t, and all I wanted was “some kind of resource” which is entirely vague.</p>

<p>Spending a few minutes to figure out what kind of problem you are having, identify some keywords, explain what you are trying to accomplish, and then giving an example of something you’ve tried can save you hours in the long run.</p>
