<p>
Before I begin, know this:
</p>
<p>
Prior to this week&#39;s blog, I already knew that there has been conversations about the lack of diversity in tech, but I have not given it much thought. Once I started researching, I realized that there has been a lot more conversation on the topic than I anticipated.
</p>

<p>
What I thought was an issue I will just need to &#34;deal with&#34; when I enter the industry, is now an issue that I will not be able to ignore. My research has led me to believe that there is a systemic problem in tech. 
</p>

<p>
One thing I learned was that a lot of people outright deny that there is a diversity problem. How can we fix the problem, if we can&#39;t even agree that there is a problem?
</p>

<p>
I started to explain why there should be diversity in the workplace:
<ul>
<li>The demographics of a company serving a community should aim to match the diversity of those they serve.</li>
<li>Diversity brings different ideas to the table.</li>
<li>Lack of diversity suffocates creativity when there are no dissenting voices.</li>
<li>Women bring about more humane work conditions, which <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/comment-analysis/WCMS_237435/lang--en/index.htm">benefit men</a> as well.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When trying to defend the need for diversity, inevitably, the problem comes down to the fact that sexism and racism still exist today. Acknowledging that is fundamental to addressing the diversity problem. WHY we need diversity can be discussed at great length and in great depth, but it leads me away from the reason I am writing this article: How to solve the problem of diversity.
</p>

<p>
So, I will be brief in explaining much of the background and existing debate in order to open up discussion to find solutions to the problem.
</p>


<p class='articleheadings'>What is the problem?</p>
<p>
There is not enough diversity in tech, and it is one of the biggest problems facing the tech industry today.
</p>

<figure><img src="/images/google_demographics.png" alt="google demographics"><figcaption>Demographics chart from Google's blog</figcaption></figure>

<p>
Tech giants Google, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Yahoo, and others, have all self-reported their demographic data, revealing that there is both a severe imbalance on both in terms of race and gender.
</p>

<p class='articleheadings'>Why is that a problem?</p>
<p>
The tech boom is generating a greater income disparity, which comes with consequences. The media has recently highlighted much of the outlash against tech companies in the bay area by some of those who feel displaced. This makes it a class issue as well.
</p>

<p>
There is an argument that tech is a meritocracy, but there have been studies that prove it is a myth. Computers do not see skin color or gender, but humans do. <a href='http://qz.com/66866/once-and-for-all-tech-is-not-a-meritocracy/'>The human factor is not free from bias.</a>
</p>

<p>
When access to opportunity is split along lines of race and gender, even when the bias is subconscious,  this becomes a problem.
</p>

<p>That also means this is a problem that we can fix if we raise awareness.</p>


<p class='articleheadings'>Why should anyone care?</p>
<p>
This is where we can get very philosophical.
</p>

<p>
Why care about racism or sexism? Why care about class divide? Is it our job as a society to provide equal opportunities for everyone? Are businesses responsible for maintaining a diverse workforce? Aren&#39;t we all of the human race? Is true capitalism a true free market? Is technology the pioneer of the future of human civilization?
</p>

<p>
These types of questions are best left for a different forum.
</p>

<p>
What I am proposing will assume that it is in everyone&#39;s best interests to promote diversity in the tech industry.
</p>

<p class='articleheadings'>How did this become a problem in tech?</p>

<p>
There are many factors that limit the inclusion of women and minorities. These factors may be causing the lack of diversity in tech:</p>
<ol>

<li>The hiring process - it is not free of bias.</li>

<li>The educational pipeline - not enough girls and minorities are getting computer science majors, and not enough girls and minorities are being taught at a young age that they can pursue tech.</li>

<li>Workplace culture is not conducive at acceptance of women and minorities.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each of these factors contribute to the lack of diversity we see in tech today.</p>


<p class='articleheadings'>What are some possible solutions?</p>
<p>
Our goal is to promote diversity by increasing the number of women and minorities that enter the tech industry.
</p>

<p>
To do this, we can look at the three potential problem areas: The hiring process, the workplace culture, and the educational pipeline.
</p>

<p>
The first two seem like they should only be in the hands of the administrators and managers of the companies, but I would argue that everybody in tech must take steps to solve the problem as well. As mentioned before, the first step is addressing that the problem exists.
</p>

<p>
As that only addresses the conditions of the people already in the industry, I would like to focus on the people coming into the industry, the educational pipeline.</p>

<p class='articleheadings'>How do we increase interest and training for women and children?</p>


<p>
There has already been a lot of action to increase the number of women and minorities in the educational pipeline leading up to tech. Programs that focus on teaching young kids of color how to code are gaining popularity. Training programs for adult women and women of color are becoming more common.
</p>

<p>
We need to start targeting those who are underrepresented at a young age by increasing interest, training, and visibility.
</p>


<p>
<b>Interest:</b>
Games, books, and toys that children play with need to market to girls and minorities, not just young boys.
</p>

<p>
Playing video games can spark interest in technology early on, but a lot of the games out there are designed for a male audience.
</p>

<p>
Books is just one way stories are told to little kids, and there should be more stories of girls becoming engineers and problem solvers.</p>


<p>
<b>Training:</b>
Add computer science and programming to all schools. These programs are especially lacking in lower income and minority neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
The school system must adopt a curriculum that includes mandatory computer programming throughout all ages of children&#39;s elementary and secondary years.</p>


<p>
<b>Visibility:</b>
Kids need role models. They need to see someone who looks like them working in the tech field and succeeding. See mirror-tocracy.
</p>

<p>
Increase the appearance of these role models in the media. Increase awareness in the entertainment industry. This is where young kids get exposed their childhood role models and form ideas of what they want to be when they grow up.
</p>

<p>
Those who are minorities in the tech field need to be more active in minority communities that they represent. Women in tech should be reaching out to young girls, showing them that they too can become a software engineer or web developer, etc.
</p>


<p class='articleheadings'>Conclusion:</p>
<p>
Environmental factors that shape who we are start very early in life, and those who are at a disadvantage economically and culturally must be brought up to the same playing field. By leveling the playing field for girls and children of color, we are on track to raising a more inclusive and thoughtful generation of problem solvers and technological pioneers.
</p>

<p>
Also, by addressing this problem now, our generation will in turn become more thoughtful and inclusive as well, the perfect role models for the next generation.</p>
