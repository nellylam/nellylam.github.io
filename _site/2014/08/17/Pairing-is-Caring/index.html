				<p class='articleheadings'>Phase 0 - Intro to Pairing</p>
<p>
	Now that we have had five weeks of pairings under our belt, I no longer feel anxious about pairing. I actually lost count of how many times I&#39;ve paired, as it has come up organically now.
</p>
<p>
	It&#39;s been very productive to pair with other people to solve our weekly challenges. The first few weeks, it was still a new concept. People were still a little bit shy, and I felt like I was treading cautiously, especially since we were meeting each other for the first time. 
</p>
<p>
	Sometimes, when I pair with someone for the first time, it made more sense to just get to know the other person first.
</p>
<p><em class='subheading'>The challenge in pair programming.</em>
	After we get acquainted and dive into the challenge, it becomes a very intense endeavor. We are focused on the task at hand, but I am still careful about communicating as clearly as I can, but without taking over the whole conversation.
</p>
<p>
	Sometimes I sense that my partner is not talking much. Then I feel bad when I catch myself taking over as navigator when I should be driving, or vice versa. 
</p>
<p>
	It also sucks when we get really stuck, and the hours pass by, and we end up having to walk away from the problem. That has happened a couple times, but when it happens, I am grateful when my partner suggests we take a break and try again the next day.
</p>
<p>
	As we get used to pairing, I think we will all get better at it.
</p>
<p><em class='subheading'>There are fun times too!</em>
	I really enjoy figure out a solution during a pairing session, because we get to celebrate when we finally figure it out! It&#39;s just not the same screaming <em>&#34;yaaaaayyyy!!!&#34;</em> to my cat. If you&#39;ve paired with me before, you may have experienced this.
</p>
<p>
	The celebrating, that is.
</p>
<p>
	Well, you may also have met my cat. She gets hungry at around 6pm... but her feeding time is fairly strictly at 7. She&#39;s a little overweight, so I apologize if she meows her head off while we are pairing and I refused to feed her. Speaking of pairing, Bebe is the worst study partner. 
</p>
<figure><a href="../images/bebe.JPG"><img src="../images/bebe.JPG" alt="cat photo"></a><figcaption>Photo for reference. This is her usual study pose.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ahem... where was I? Oh yes, feeding.</p>
<p class='articleheadings'>Feedback: Feeding the Feedbackinator</p>
<p>
	Getting feedback is like opening a box of chocolates, you never know what you&#39;re gonna get.
</p>
<p>
	Well, thanks to the Feedbackinator, where every feedback must be Actionable, Specific, and Kind, all of the feedback I&#39;ve gotten has been very kind. (Thanks to everyone who&#39;s put up with me so far!)
</p>
<p><em class='subheading'>Things to work on.</em>
	I do not come off as a very confident person, but I am confident that I am a good partner, that I do my best in the given challenge, and I try to be respectful and fun! The feedback so far has really boosted my self-confidence. (So thank you again!)
</p>
<p>
	Several people have suggested that I speak up more when I feel like we are going in the wrong direction. I have noticed that when I feel we are going in the wrong direction, I hesitate to speak up, because I don&#39;t want to offend my partner or shut out their ideas. I need to practice being more open and assertive, but hopefully in a respectable way. 
</p>
<p><em class='subheading'>Giving back.</em>
	When it comes to doling out feedback, I try to follow the A.S.K. principles. I think it is important to be honest, but also be very mindful of the words and language that we use. I hope that my feedback will help the other person in future pairing sessions or just in general.
</p>
<p>
	The hardest part about writing feedback is not knowing how the other person will react. When we give feedback face to face, we can read each other&#39;s mood and body language. Writing does not convey the amount of care and consideration that is put into the feedback. Anyone who has had a conversation by text message can agree.
</p>
<p>
	Maybe we need emojis in the Feedbackinator! Can we give the feedbackinator feedback? That would be meta meta-feedback!
</p>
<p class='articleheadings'>But seriously.</p>
<p>
	All seriousness aside, I think that pairing is incredibly beneficial to our learning. It helps me stay focused. Managing my time throughout the week is closely correlated to how many times I pair up.
</p>
<p>
	Multiply that by the feedback we are sending each other, and it is certain that we will succeed as long as we continue to work hand in hand to become awesome!
