						<h3 class="postname">Why Javascript?</h3>

						<p class='articleheadings'>What IS Javascript anyway?</p>
						<p>It's a scripting languages. It gives the browser (or other type of host environment) a prescribed set of actions to execute one after the other, like a movie script for an actor.</p>
						<p class='articleheadings'>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</p>
						<p>You have probably heard someone say this before: "JavaScript is the language of the web". Why? What does that even mean?</p>
						<p>Well JavaScript is supported by all internet browsers from Chrome to Firefox to Safari, etc. That's cool, but why?</p>
						<p>To better phrase it, why is it so popular? It probably had to do with the fact that back in the day, when Netscape and Internet Explorer were the two main browsers, they both supported Javascript. So it all started in the beginning... that's where the Javascript seed was planted. Why?</p>
						<p>In the great words of Louis C.K. "Because some things ARE and some things AREN'T."</p>
						<p>That's just how it came to BE.</p>
						<p class='articleheadings'>What are the great things about JavaScript?</p>
						<p>Ok, after accepting the former explanation, you still trust me to tell you what's so great about JavaScript. Well here's a handy list, because no one likes long paragraphs!</p>
						<ul>
							<li>It's widely used amongst all browsers.</li>
							<li>It works "seamlessly" with HTML and CSS to make awesome websites.</li>
							<li>It's easy to learn.</li>
							<li>It's easy to edit. All you need is a text editor.</li>
							<li>It's fast, because it's client side (that's you), so there is less load on the server (that's the stuff behind the curtain).</li>
							<li>It's easy to learn, but can also be very powerful.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class='articleheadings'>What are its limitations?</p>
						<p>It's not perfect, in fact it's always improving. So what are some things that still suck about JavaScript?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Security - because JavaScript runs on the user's computer, it could potentially be exploited for malicious intent.</li>
							<li>Results may vary - It relies on the end-user, so the output can be unpredictable for special circumstances. That's why you should test on all the major browsers.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class='articleheadings'>So what'll it be?</p>
						<p>It's so standard and widely used that you'll definitely need to learn how to speak the language if you're going to get into web development.</p>
