						<!-- This is the actual blog post! -->
						<p>After watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a>, I now have an greater appreciation and understanding for the Dev Bootcamp mentality. It really struck a few chords with me.</p>
						<p>The Kitchen vs Table analogy is very relatable. I think I especially relate to the Table mentality, having gone through so much schooling. I have gotten used to getting assignments, doing as much as is needed to jump through hoops, and getting a degree or a grade afterwards. It has really damaged my natural drive to learn and to have fun doing it. I have always loved learning new things, but I think it's going to be a personal challenge to get out of the entitled mentality and really take matters into my own hands. I think that for the first time in a long time though, I have found something I really enjoy, so it won't be <b>that</b> hard. I hope.</p>
						<p>The Rabbit Hole: Yes. This is me. This was me this week. I spent way too much time going into details, diving deep into topics and not having enough discipline (or the perspective that I do now) to stop and resume the task at hand. I think there's also an opposite problem too. Instead of diving deep into something that leads to more and more new things, I have been focusing on the tiniest thing that leads nowhere. By that, I mean specifically when I am trying to pick colors for my blog, or a font, or the worst one - a blog <b>name</b>. I like the idea of setting small tasks on a 20-minute timer. That'll do.</p>
						<p>Knowing when to say "I don't know" is important. I think that goes together with the mistake of comparing myself to others. It's just how I was trained to think since I was a little kid, so it's going to be difficult. I've also never been in an environment that's as collaborative and positive and supportive as the technology world, so I am not TOO worried, but I will try to be more aware of my own self-deprecating thoughts.</p>
						<p>I am excited for the DBC experience. I think it is nurturing as well as life-changing, and I am prepared to go in with an open mind and motivation. This sounds cheesy, but I imagine we will all be one big family, but not like the kind where you fight with your siblings and have rivalries, but the kind that's kind of like the end of summer camp when everyone goes their separate ways, and there's a lot of hugging and maybe some crying. Yeah, it's cheesy, but I'm not going to be embarrassed. I hope this happens.</p>
						<p>Going into prep, I felt that the material was too easy. I had been studying ruby and rails on my own prior to this, and since the prep work has been given out, I have stopped all of that other prep entirely. I not only underestimated the amount of work in Week 1 curriculum, but I also undermined my own learning track by not doing the other extra studying. Like Shareef said, no matter what, I'm still going to be learning a lot from Day 1 at DBC, so I better gear up for it so I can hit the ground running.</p>
						<p>How do I feel now? Motivated and Inspired.</p>
