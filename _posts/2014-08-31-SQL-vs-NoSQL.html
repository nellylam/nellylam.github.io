<p>We&#39;ve done some work with SQL already, but what is NoSQL?</p>
<p class='articleheadings'>NoSQL means "Not Only SQL"</p>
<blockquote>&#34;A NoSQL database environment is, simply put, a non-relational and largely distributed database system that enables rapid, ad-hoc organization and analysis of extremely high-volume, disparate data types.&#34; - Planet Cassandra</blockquote>
<em class='subheading'>Other names for NoSQL:</em>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>cloud databases</li>
		<li>non-relational databases</li>
		<li>Big Data databases</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<em class='subheading'>Characteristics of NoSQL:</em>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non relational</li>
		<li>Scalable</li>
		<li>Structures: hashes, maps, dictionaries</li>
		<li>No pre-defined schema</li>
		<li>No join operations</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<em class='subheading'>Advantages of NoSQL:</em>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cheap</li>
		<li>Data are replicated and can be partitioned</li>
		<li>Easy to distribute</li>
		<li>Where SQL uses a schema to structure its data, NoSQL has no schema.</li>
		<li>It can handle a LOT more data. We&#39;re talking about millions of users.</li>
		<li>It&#39;s fast, and can quickly process large amount of data</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<em class='subheading'>Disdvantages of NoSQL:</em>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>NoSQL is still new, so it is sometimes buggy</li>
		<li>Data is duplicated for redundancy</li>
		<li>No standardized schema</li>
		<li>No standard format for queries.</li>
		<li>No standard language</li>
		<li>Difficult to impose complicated structures</li>
		<li>Depend on the application layer to enforce data integrity</li>
		<li>No guarantee of support</li>
		<li>Too many options</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p class='articleheadings'>There are different types of NoSql databases.</p>
<em class='subheading'>Key - Value</em>
<p>Key-value databases are easy to work with, scalable, and fast. They are useful for caching, quickly storing data for future use, queuing, distributing information and tasks, and keeping live information.</p>
<p>Examples of Key-Value databases include Redis, Riak, and Memcached / MemchacheDB.</p>
<em class='subheading'>Column Databases</em>
<p>This is similar to the row-and-column structure of a relational database, but does not include the strict rules of the relational database.</p>
<p>
	Column based databases are powerful, and can keep important data of very large sizes. Itâ€™s not very flexible, but highly functional, and fast. They are good for keeping unstructured, non-volatile information that can be stored for a long time. They are also very scalable and can handle an extremely large amount of information.
</p>
<p>
	Some examples of column databases are Cassandra, HBase, and Amazon SimpleDB.
</p>
<em class='subheading'>Document Databases</em>
<p>
	Document databases are great for keeping large amounts of unrelated and complex information that is highly variable in structure. The objects are documents that are encoded in a common file format such as XML or PDF and stored as a value in a key-value pair. You can query the document.
</p>
<p>
	Document databases are useful for nesting information in deeply complex data structures. They are also JavaScript friendly, interfacing with applications, by using JSON.
</p>
<p>
	Some popular document databases are Couchbase, CouchDB, and MongoDB.
</p>
<em class='subheading'>Graph Databases</em>
<p>
	Graph databases offer a unique way to store data that handle complex relational information. It deals with the relational information between two entities. Graph databases can model and handle the classification of information in a relational way.
</p>
<p>
	Some popular examples of graph databases include OrientDB and Neo4J.
</p>
<p class='articleheadings'>When to use NoSQL databases:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Size - when working with massively large sets of data.</li>
		<li>Speed - extremely faster to write data, but reading can depend on which type of database and what is being queried.</li>
		<li>Schema-free - flexibility in structure.</li>
		<li>Automated replications and scaling - NoSQL administrators add redundancy using replication by simply adding secondary nodes to the primary nodes, and is therefore very scalable.</li>
		<li>Multiple choices  - There are many models, and you can choose the one that best fits your data type.</li>
	</ul>

<p>
	<b>Conclusion:</b> it&#39;s a tie. They both offer great benefits, so it just depends what data you are storing.
</p>
<p>
	It is possible to use both SQL and NoSQL in conjunction. SQL could store active data as memory, and NoSQL can store archived data, such as in a disk.
