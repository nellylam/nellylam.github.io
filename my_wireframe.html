<p>In creating and redesigning the Code Habits website, I had to identify what are the problems I am trying to solve. What do I think is important for my users?</p>

<p>First, I want to make my blogs easy to find from the homepage.
Second, the blogs must be easy to read.
Less urgent, but also importantly, I want to let people know more about me. How does my website tell other's who I am? I figured, this is going to happen implicitly through my blogs.</p>

<p>When creating the wireframes, I sketched a few pages of thumbnails. I realize that the home page and the blog pages will be different.</p>

<p>On the homepage, I wanted large, easy to find, and graphically simple links to the Blog, Projects, and About pages. In the actual blog article page, I want the user to easily find their way to other articles. So I kept the nav bar at the top, and eventually I want to have drop down menus showing links to all the blog posts.</p>

<p>The last step would be to make my blog reponsive to different browser sizes and easily read on a mobile device.</p>
